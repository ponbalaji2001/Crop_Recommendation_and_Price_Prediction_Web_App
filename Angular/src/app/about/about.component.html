        <h1>Challenges in Agriculture</h1>
        <p>In this world, the need for food and nourishment surpasses all other needs. Most of the food production is contributed
            by agriculture. Therefore, agriculture is at the heart of the economy in any country. Especially in India due to
            increasing population the thirst for latest technologies is imminent. Accurate predictions of crop yields and prices are
            required by farmers in general to make educated decisions on planting, harvesting, and marketing their crops.</p>
        <p>The traditional or existing system of agriculture faces a major issue, that is, fluctuation in the prices of crop
            produce. The rise in prices leads to increased cost of living and the fall in prices leads to increased profit. Due to
            its unpredictable nature, it might lead to problems such as investment loss. Moreover, most of the farmers are unaware
            of the market demand and face difficulties in marketing their product. They sometimes tend to estimate the soilâ€™s
            potential incorrectly and raise their hopes up.</p>
        <p>Decades ago, naked eye observation and instinct were enough to predict the weather but nowadays due to globalization,
            the weather has become unpredictable. Hence another issue lies in predicting weather conditions, which can affect the
            yield drastically. Inaccurate predictions can pose a danger to the food security of any country.</p>
        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to empower farmers with accurate and timely information to help them make informed decisions about their crops. By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms
        and real-time agro-meteorological data, we provide farmers with precise crop recommendations based on their local soil
        moisture, rainfall, temperature, and other parameters.</p>
        <p>In addition, we offer real-time crop price predictions, enabling farmers to stay updated with the market demand and
        trends and make informed decisions about when to sell their crops to obtain maximum profit. Our ultimate goal is to help
        farmers increase their yield and profitability, while minimizing their crop loss and investment risk.</p>
        <h1>Who we are</h1>
        <p>We are a team of engineering students who are passionate about utilizing technology to revolutionize the
        agricultural industry. With our expertise in machine learning, we have developed a
        platform that provides farmers with accurate crop recommendations and real-time price predictions to optimize their
        yield and maximize their profit.</p>
        <p>Our team is dedicated to continuously improving our algorithms and incorporating the latest advancements in technology
        to ensure that our recommendations are always up-to-date and accurate. We are committed to providing a user-friendly and
        accessible platform for farmers of all levels of experience to make informed decisions about their crops and ultimately
        improve their productivity and profitability.</p>
